Architectural Drawing Management 
Simple code to collect and utilise created metadata of the files and then filter and dislay small images, 
if selected then it will launch the registered PDF reader in a new window with that file in it.
Allows filtering by location, discipline and drawing type.
The effort is in the creation of the Metadata, this makes the app useful or stupid.
Crude but necessary!
